# clicky

Overview

This Simpsons characters memory game is built with React. Each time a user clicks on a character, the application randomly sorts the order of the characters. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user earns a point each time the user clicks on a character for the first time. The user's score resets to zero if the user clicks on the same character more than once.
